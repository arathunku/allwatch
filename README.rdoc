This is my first ruby on rails attempt to make something useful, and indeed it is! Although only like 10 users registered for now but as far as I know it's useful for them.

The code need A LOT OF refactoring and more tests, specially my custom module for Allegro api. For now it's working, have not heard of any issues.


To-do:
  * shareable links to looks
  * add persona log in
  * capistrano script for easy deployment
  * ideas?
